# Portfolio Layout & Aesthetic Rule Book

> **Goal:** Deliver a visually rich, information-dense experience that feels premium yet effortless. Every screen should feel full, balanced, and immediately meaningful—with minimal scrolling and zero dead space.

---

## 1. Layout Philosophy
- **Single-glance completeness:** Each viewport (desktop/laptop) must tell a complete story; avoid fragmenting sections across multiple scrolls.
- **Minimal vertical scroll:** Target 1–1.5 viewport heights per primary section. If a section exceeds this, compress content or split logically into tabs/carousels.
- **Edge-to-edge intent:** Use the full horizontal canvas—avoid large side gutters unless needed for breathing room.
- **Visually balanced density:** Fill negative space with supporting elements (stats, mini-badges, subtle animations) rather than leaving blank gaps.

## 2. Content Packing Guidelines
- **Hero sections:** Fit title, subtitle, CTA, social badges, and at least one visual element (photo/model/screenshot) within the initial fold.
- **Cards & grids:** Prefer 3–4 column grids on desktop. Use masonry or equal-height cards to keep baselines aligned and avoid awkward white space.
- **Text blocks:** Keep paragraphs 2–3 sentences. Use pill badges, highlight blocks, or side quotes to break monotony.
- **Media usage:** Replace static gaps with looping Lottie animations, subtle particle layers, or marquee text.

## 3. Scroll & Navigation Rules
- **Scroll zones:** Maximum of three primary vertical sections before a navigation break (tabs, accordions, or horizontal scroll galleries).
- **Sticky anchors:** Keep a sticky sub-nav for long sections so users can jump without scrolling.
- **Micro-interactions over long pages:** Convey depth via hover reveals, tooltips, and draggable elements instead of additional scroll length.

## 4. Spacing & Rhythm
- **Vertical rhythm:** Maintain consistent spacing scale (e.g., 4/8/12/16px). Largest block spacing ≤ 80px.
- **Component padding:** Cards/panels use tight inner padding (16–24px). Avoid >32px unless showcasing hero content.
- **Section dividers:** Use gradient fades, glassmorphism bars, or slim separators rather than large empty bands.

## 5. Typography & Hierarchy
- **Headline compression:** Leading for hero titles ≤ 1.1 to conserve space; rely on font weight and contrast for emphasis.
- **Multi-column text:** For longer descriptions, use 2-column layouts on desktop to reduce height.
- **Inline stats:** Transform key metrics into inline chips/badges instead of standalone blocks.

## 6. Responsive Considerations
- **Tablet:** Collapse 3–4 column grids into 2 columns while maintaining minimal vertical overflow.
- **Mobile:** Allow more scroll but keep each screen packed—no blank filler between sections. Use accordions to condense secondary info.

## 7. Visual Cohesion Checklist
- [ ] Every section fills at least 85% of the viewport height.
- [ ] No section relies on blank negative space; decorative elements or data chips fill gaps.
- [ ] Navigation anchors or tabs provided for any content taller than 150vh.
- [ ] Consistent spacing scale applied across components.
- [ ] Hero, projects, stats, and contact each fit within one scroll segment.
